## Our Mission

Help community, enterprise and nations achieve the Global Goals through direct action, training and technology, locally.

## Our Vision

A global community working together to help nations achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets:
- 500 Ladder Communities
- 17,000 innovation sprints on critical issues by 2025
- Doubling that impact by 2030

## Our Story

The Ladder was founded in April 2018 to help nations achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through direct action and technology. We incorporate experimentation, design thinking, and product management expertise from companies like Google, Facebook, and IBM into a proven framework that addresses the urgent challenge of meeting the SDGs.

Conventional approaches weren't making sufficient progress toward the Global Goals. The Ladder provides a different, data-driven, rapid validation approach. Our big goal and innovative framework created a sustainable social enterprise that has grown to become the largest public Global Goals accelerator in the world.

## Our Approach: Design Thinking = Doing

We've adapted proven design thinking methodologies into a six-step process tailored for different organization types. This approach de-risks initiatives before they launch or scale:

1. **Ladder Jam / Research Sprint** (1-5 days)
   - Research interviews
   - Key risks & challenges identification
   - Customer personas development
   - Journey mapping

2. **Design Sprint** (3-5 days)
   - Validated/invalidated proposition
   - Prototype/wireframes
   - User testing results
   - Roadmap and next actions

3. **Go Sprints** (1-4 weeks)
   - MVP development
   - Validation
   - First customer touchpoints
   - Iteration based on feedback

4. **Customer Validation, Ground Services, Training and Launch** (4-12 weeks)
   - Onboarding
   - Customer testing results
   - Team certification
   - Monitoring
   - Updated roadmap

## Our Team

The Ladder was incorporated as a non-profit (The Ladder Community CLG) in 2019.

**Original Founders Team:**
- Colm Byrne (Ireland) - Director
- Ruta Danyte (Lithuania) 
- Jacques Vermaak (South Africa)

## Why It Matters

> "Every person, every community, every business, every home, every farm and every school will have to make changes in the way we live, and work and travel."
> 
> â€” Richard Bruton, Minister of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Ireland (Jan 2019)

We believe that by scaling community action locally, we can solve critical issues the way technology scales globally. This is The Ladder Experiment.
