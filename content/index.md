## The Ladder Framework

Our method rapidly validates and iterates solutions to get them right:

1. **Define the Problem** - Research interviews, identify key risks and challenges
2. **Design Sprint** - Develop validated propositions and prototypes 
3. **User Testing** - Test with real users to validate solutions
4. **Deployment** - Move validated solutions to implementation

> "Saved us months of effort. The Ladder team validated our product with users- so we now know what work to prioritise. Thumbs up."
